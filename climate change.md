| `Page 62`   | **Sustainable Development**                                  | In 2017, the Company continued the process of incorporating health, safety and environmental sustainability into all aspects and stages of its business, from the corporate objectives and executive responsibility of ‘maintaining high standards in sustainability’ to exploration and acquisition activities, day to day operating and site closure. This integration began in 2012 with the adoption of an integrated Health, Safety, Environment and Social Acceptability Policy (the ‘‘Sustainable Development Policy’’) that reflects the Company’s commitment to responsible mining practices. The Company believes that the Sustainable Development Policy will lead to the achievement of more sustainable practices through oversight and accountability.<br/><br/>The Sustainable Development Policy operates through the development and implementation of a formal and integrated Health, Safety and Environmental Management System, termed the Responsible Mining Management System (the ‘‘RMMS’’), across all divisions of the Company. The Partnership has committed to implementing the RMMS at Canadian Malartic in the future. The aim of the RMMS is to promote a culture of accountability and leadership in managing health, safety, environmental and social acceptability matters. RMMS implementation is supported by software widely used in the Canadian mining industry that is consistent with the ISO 14001 Environmental Management System and the Occupational Health and Safety Assessment Series 18001 Health and Safety Management System.<br/><br/>The RMMS incorporates the Company’s commitments as a signatory to the Cyanide Code, a voluntary program that addresses the safe production, transport, storage, handling and disposal of cyanide. The Company became a signatory to the Cyanide Code in September 2011.<br/><br/>The RMMS also integrates the requirements of the Mining Association of Canada’s industry leading Towards Sustainable Mining Initiative (the ‘‘TSM Initiative’’), as well as the Global Reporting Initiative’s sustainability reporting guidelines for the mining industry. In December 2010, the Company became a member of the Mining Association of Canada and endorsed the TSM Initiative. The TSM Initiative was developed to help mining companies evaluate the quality, comprehensiveness and< robustness of their management systems under six performance elements: crisis management; energy and greenhouse gas emissions management; tailings management; biodiversity conservation management; health and safety; and aboriginal relations and community outreach.<br/><br/>The Company has adopted and implemented the World Gold Council’s Conflict Free Gold Standard. This implementation was initiated on January 1, 2013.<br/><br/>In 2017, the Company adopted the Voluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights, a set of principles designed to guide companies in maintaining the safety and security of their operations within an operating framework that encourages respect for human rights.<br/><br/>The Company’s Sustainable Development Policy is available on the Company’s website at www.agnicoeagle.com.The Canadian Malartic mine’s sustainable development report is available at its website, www.canadianmalartic.com. | 1.  The Company continued the process of incorporating health, safety, and environmental sustainability into all business stages in 2017.<br/>2. Sustainability efforts range from corporate objectives to daily operations and site closure. |
| `Page 63**` | **Environmental Protection**                                 | The Company has reported greenhouse gas emissions and climate change risk factors annually to the Carbon Disclosure Project since 2007.<br/><br/>The Company’s exploration activities and mining and processing operations are subject to the federal, state, provincial, territorial, regional and local environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which the Company’s activities and facilities are located. These include requirements for planning and implementing the closure and reclamation of mining properties and related financial assurance. Each mine is subject to environmental assessment and permitting processes during development and, in operation, has an environmental management system consistent with ISO 140001 as well as an internal audit program. The Company works closely with regulatory authorities in each jurisdiction where it operates to ensure ongoing compliance.<br/><br/>In 2015, Environment Canada charged the Company with two infractions under the Fisheries Act in relation to a seepage incident at the Meadowbank mine that was identified during a July 2013 on-site inspection. Monitoring data indicated that the 2013 seepage event did not affect the water quality of the downstream Second Portage Lake. In 2017, the Company paid a C$50,000 fine in full satisfaction thereof.<br/><br/>With respect to activities in 2017, the Canadian Malartic mine received three non-compliance blast notices, an increase from the single infraction received with respect to activities in 2016. The mine’s team of on-site environmental experts continue to monitor regulatory compliance in terms of approvals, permits and observance of directives and requirements and continue to implement improvement measures.<br/><br/>The Company’s total liability for reclamation and closure cost obligations at December 31, 2017 was $355.3 million (including the Company’s share of the Canadian Malartic reclamation costs) and the Company’s reclamation expenses for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $0.9 million. <br/><br/>For more information please see note 12 to the Annual Financial Statements.The Company’s Environmental Policy is available on the Company’s website at www.agnicoeagle.com. | Mentions about safety records and the presence of Emergency Response Plans at the company's mining operations. |

| `Page 18` | **EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AND ADVISORY BOARDS**            | **Corporate Social Responsibility Advisory Board**<br/><br/> Barrick’s Corporate Social Responsibility Advisory Board was formed in 2012, and acts as an external sounding board on a range of corporate responsibility issues, including community relations, sustainable development, water, energy, climate change, security, and human rights.<br/><br/>![](C:\Users\Asus\Desktop\444.png) |         |
| `Page 20` | **Management’s Discussion<br/>and Analysis (“MD&A”)** | **Cautionary Statement on Forward-Looking Information**<br/><br/>Risks associated with the fact that certain of the initiatives described in this MD&A are still in the early stages and may not materialize; our ability to successfully integrate acquisitions or complete divestitures; risks associated with working with partners in jointly controlled assets;< employee relations including loss of key employees; increased costs and physical risks, including extreme weather events and resource shortages, related to climate change; availability and increased costs associated with mining inputs and labor; and the organization of our previously held African gold operations and properties under a separate listed Company. |         |
| `Page 28` | **Climate Change**                                    | Climate change, including shifts in temperature and precipitation and more frequent severe weather events, will affect the mining industry in a range of possible ways. Volatile climatic conditions can affect the stability and effectiveness of infrastructure and equipment; potentially impact environmental protection and site closure practices; lead to changes in the regulatory environment, including increased carbon tax regimes; and potentially impact the stability and cost of water and energy supplies. We therefore view climate change as a company, community, and global concern. In 2017, we developed a climate change strategy aligned with our overall business strategy to grow free cash flow per share through safe and responsible mining. <br/><br/>Barrick’s climate change strategy has three pillars: understand and mitigate the risks associated with climate change; reduce our impacts on climate change; and improve our disclosure on climate change. Action taken on each pillar in 2017 is described below. <br/><br/>Understand and mitigate the risks associated with climate change: In 2017, we performed a climate change risk assessment, using our standard risk management framework. We assessed risks and opportunities across both potential transition (e.g., regulatory, policy, reputational) and physical (e.g., extreme climate events) aspects of climate change. We have identified the top three climate-related risks and opportunities for our business: an increase in extended duration extreme precipitation events; an increase in climate change regulations to limit greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions; and increased global investment in innovation and low carbon technologies. The assessment also included a review of the current mitigation and controls associated with each risk and identified areas which may need further strengthening to reduce risk. <br/><br/>Reduce the Company’s impact on climate change: Over the course of 2017, we analyzed our current and forecasted GHG emissions to develop an ambitious but realistic goal to reduce Barrick’s GHG emissions. Mining is an energy-intensive business, and we understand the important link between energy use and GHG emissions. By effectively managing our energy use, we can reduce our draw from local energy grids, reduce our GHG emissions, achieve more efficient production, and save direct mining costs. Barrick has set a goal to keep its current GHG emissions flat in the short term and is targeting a 30 percent reduction in GHG emissions by 2030, from a 2016 baseline of 3.5 MT CO2e emitted. This target is also closely aligned with the national targets set by many of our host governments.<br/><br/>Improve our disclosure on climate change: In 2017, we committed to supporting the voluntary recommendations of the industry-led Financial Stability Board Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (“TCFD”). The TCFD recommendations are considered the new benchmark for disclosure of climate-related risks and opportunities, and Barrick was the only Canadian mining company to make this public commitment. We will implement the full recommendations over the next two years. <br/><br/>Governance over climate-related risks and opportunities is provided at both the Board and management level. The Board’s Corporate Responsibility Committee meets at least quarterly and is responsible for overseeing Barrick’s policies, programs, and performance relating to the environment, including climate change. The Risk Committee assists the Board in overseeing the Company’s management of enterprise risks as well as the implementation of policies and standards for monitoring and mitigating such risks. Climate change is built into our formal risk management process, outputs of which are reviewed by the Risk Committee. The Audit Committee reviews the Company’s approach to climate change in the context of Barrick’s disclosures. <br/><br/>At the management level, our Climate Change Committee, comprised of senior members of our management team, provides strategic oversight and governance over key decisions related to Barrick’s Climate Change Strategy, such as overseeing climate change risk and opportunity assessments, monitoring progress against GHG emissions targets, and providing guidance on external disclosures. <br/><br/>Further to the specific focus of the Climate Change Committee, the weekly BPR allows for the discussion of opportunities and risks that may help or hinder the Company from achieving its objectives, including climaterelated risks (e.g., spring snow melts, hurricanes, flooding, and mud slides). <br/><br/>Climate change activities initiated in 2017 will continue into 2018 and beyond. Site-level climaterelated risks and mitigation plans will be reviewed in the context of the company-wide risk assessment, and site-level plans to reduce energy and GHG emissions will be strengthened. We will continue to enhance our climate-related disclosure according to the TCFD recommendations. Overall, based on the groundwork completed in 2017, Barrick is building resilience to withstand the potential impacts of climate change and leverage potential opportunities as the global economy transitions to a low-carbon future. |         |
| `Page 39` | **Social license to operate**                         | At Barrick, we are committed to building, operating, and closing our mines in a safe and responsible manner. To do this, we seek to develop long-term and mutuallybeneficial relationships with host governments and communities while working to minimize the social and environmental impacts of our activities. Geopolitical risks such as resource nationalism and incidents of corruption are inherent for a company operating globally. Past environmental incidents in the extractive industry highlight the hazards (e.g., water management, tailings storage facilities, etc.) and the potential consequences to both the environment and community health and safety. Barrick also recognizes climate change as an area of risk requiring specific focus. Our ability to maintain compliance with regulatory and community obligations in order to protect the environment and our host communities alike remains one of our top priorities. |         |
| `Page 39` | **Key Risk Modification Activities**                  | 1. Our external Corporate Social Responsibility Advisory Board was formed in 2012 and provides expert advice to the Company on a range of corporate social responsibility matters, including community relations, sustainable development, water, energy, climate change, security and human rights; <br/><br/>2. Our obligations, expectations and intentions are codified in our Vision and Values and the Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, and they are reinforced regularly at all levels of the Company;<br/><br/>3. We participate in the annual CDP Climate Change and Water Disclosure process, providing investors and other interested partners with detailed information on our water and energy use and emissions data; <br/><br/>4. Under the direction of the Climate Change committee, we performed a climate change risk assessment. Refer to page 28 for details; and <br/><br/>5. We continually review and update our closure plans and cost estimates to plan for environmentally responsible closure and monitoring of operations. |         |

| `Page 31` | **Climate Change**                                | Climate change, including shifts in temperature and precipitation and more frequent severe weather events, will affect the mining industry in a range of possible ways. Volatile climatic conditions can affect the stability and effectiveness of infrastructure and equipment; potentially impact environmental protection and site closure practices; lead to changes in the regulatory environment, including increased carbon tax regimes; and potentially impact the stability and cost of water and energy supplies. We therefore view climate change as a company, community, and global concern. In 2017, we developed a climate change strategy aligned with our overall business strategy to grow free cash flow per share through safe and responsible mining. <br/><br/>Barrick’s climate change strategy has three pillars: understand and mitigate the risks associated with climate change; reduce our impacts on climate change; and improve our disclosure on climate change. Action taken on each pillar in 2018 is described below. <br/><br/>**Understand and mitigate the risks associated with climate change**<br/><br/>In 2018, climate change was incorporated into Barrick’s formal risk assessment process, whereby sites included climate-related factors into their risk assessment process (e.g., by considering the impact of increased precipitation, drought, or severe storms on operations as well as on communities near our operations). This followed the risk and opportunity assessment we conducted in 2017, where we identified three primary climate-related risks and opportunities for our business: an increase in extended duration extreme precipitation events; an increase in climate change regulations to limit greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions; and increased global investment in innovation and low carbon technologies.<br/><br/>**Reduce the Company’s impact on climate change**<br/><br/>Mining is an energy-intensive business, and we understand the important link between energy use and GHG emissions. By effectively managing our energy use, we can reduce our draw from local energy grids, reduce our GHG emissions, achieve more efficient production, and save direct mining costs. In 2018, a tangible example of this was the announcement of our plan to convert the Quisqueya I power generation facility in the Dominican Republic from heavy fuel oil to natural gas in 2019. Converting the facility is expected to reduce GHG emissions associated with Pueblo Viejo by approximately 260 thousand CO2 equivalent tonnes per year and reduce costs, which are reflected in our guidance. <br/><br/>Overall, our GHG emissions in 2018 were 4.0 million CO2 equivalent tonnes (MT CO2e), which is consistent with our shorter-term GHG emissions management goals.<br/><br/>**Improve our disclosure on climate change**<br/><br/>In 2018, we published our 2017/18 Climate report, which describes our climate change strategy, identified climaterelated risks and opportunities, and reported on emissions for all operating facilities and power plants. Publishing this report reflects our commitment to the voluntary disclosure of our emissions. <br/><br/>Throughout 2018, the Board’s Corporate Responsibility Committee, which met quarterly, was responsible for overseeing Barrick’s policies, programs, and performance relating to the environment, including climate change. The Risk Committee assisted the Board in overseeing the Company’s management of enterprise risks as well as the implementation of policies and standards for monitoring and mitigating such risks. Climate change is built into our formal risk management process, outputs of which were reviewed by the Risk Committee throughout 2018 (as of January 1, 2019, this Committee has been combined with the Audit Committee). In addition, the Audit Committee reviewed the Company’s approach to climate change in the context of Barrick’s public disclosure. <br/><br/>Throughout 2018, at the management level, our Climate Change Committee, comprised of senior members of our management team, provided strategic oversight and governance over key decisions related to Barrick’s Climate Change Strategy. In 2018, the Climate Change Committee focused on site-level assessment and mitigation of climaterelated risk; monitoring progress against GHG emissions targets; providing guidance on external disclosures; and initiating a climate change scenario analysis project. <br/><br/>Further to the specific focus of the Climate Change Committee, regular review meetings throughout 2018 allowed for the discussion of opportunities and risks that may help or hinder the Company from achieving its objectives, including climate-related risks (e.g., spring snow melts, hurricanes, flooding, and mud slides). Additionally, during mine site optimization reviews undertaken in the fourth quarter, each site presented for review their life of mine energy and GHG reduction plans. <br/><br/>We expect climate change activities to continue into 2019 and beyond. Site-level climate-related risks and mitigation plans will continue to be reviewed in the context of the company-wide risk assessment, and site-level plans to reduce energy and GHG emissions will be strengthened. We also expect to sustain our climate-related disclosure. Overall, based on the work completed in 2018, Barrick continues to build resilience to withstand the potential impacts of climate change and leverage potential opportunities as the global economy transitions to a low-carbon future. Following the merger between Barrick and Randgold on January 1, 2019, we are reviewing how climate-related risks and opportunities will be governed in the new company. |         |

| `Page 49` | **Cautionary Statement on Forward-Looking Information** | Our strategies and plans with respect to environmental matters, including climate change; our future plans, growth potential, financial strength, investments and overall strategy; our plans and expected completion and benefits of our growth projects, including construction of twin exploration declines at Goldrush, the Turquoise Ridge Third Shaft, Pueblo Viejo plant expansion, Zaldívar chloride leach project, and Veladero power transmission project; our ability to convert resources into reserves; asset sales, joint ventures and partnerships, including expected closing of the sale of our interest in Massawa; expectations regarding future price assumptions, financial performance and other outlook or guidance. Forward-looking statements are necessarily <br/><br/>related to climate change; and availability and increased costs associated with mining inputs and labor. In addition, there are risks and hazards associated with the business of mineral exploration, development and mining, including environmental hazards, industrial accidents, unusual or unexpected formations, pressures, cave-ins, flooding and gold bullion, copper cathode or gold or copper concentrate losses (and the risk of inadequate insurance, or inability to obtain insurance, to cover these risks).<br/><br/> |         |
| `Page 57` | **Climate Change**                                      | Climate change, including shifts in temperature and precipitation and more frequent severe weather events, could affect the mining industry in a range of possible ways. Volatile climatic conditions can affect the stability and effectiveness of infrastructure and equipment; potentially impact environmental protection and site closure practices; lead to changes in the regulatory environment, including increased carbon tax regimes; and potentially impact the stability and cost of water and energy supplies. We therefore view climate change as a company, community, and global concern. In 2019, following our merger with Randgold and the formation of Nevada Gold Mines, we reviewed and updated the climate change strategy developed in 2017. <br/><br/>Barrick’s climate change strategy has three pillars: identify, understand and mitigate the risks associated with climate change; measure and reduce our impacts on climate change; and improve our disclosure on climate change. Action taken on each pillar in 2019 is described below.<br/><br/>**Identify, understand and mitigate the risks associated with<br/>climate change**<br/><br/>resilience to climate change, as well as to position ourselves for new opportunities. In 2019, climate change-related factors continued to be incorporated into Barrick’s formal risk assessment process (for example, consideration is given to the availability of and access to water and the impact of increased precipitation, drought, or severe storms on operations as well as on communities near our operations). We have identified several climate-related risks and opportunities for our business: physical impacts of climate change, such as an increase in extended duration extreme precipitation events; an increase in regulations that seek to address climate change; and increased global investment in innovation and low-carbon technologies.<br/><br/>**Measure and reduce the Company’s impact on climate change** <br/><br/>Mining is an energy-intensive business, and we understand the important link between energy use and greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions. By effectively managing our energy use, we can reduce our draw from local energy grids, reduce our GHG emissions, achieve more efficient production, and reduce direct mining costs. In 2019, we progressed the conversion of the Quisqueya I power generation facility in the Dominican Republic from heavy fuel oil to natural gas. We expect the power plant to receive its first liquefied natural gas deliveries in first quarter 2020. The conversion will help reduce the mine site’s power generation costs and GHG emissions by 30%. We also advanced a power transmission project at Veladero to connect the mine to grid power and started construction of a solar plant at Loulo-Gounkoto. Each of these projects is expected to reduce the need for diesel generators, thereby reducing our emissions and power generation costs.<br/><br/>**Improve our disclosure on climate change**<br/><br/>In 2019, one of our first reporting activities as a merged Company was to complete the CDP (formerly known as the Carbon Disclosure Project) emissions questionnaire which makes investor-relevant climate data widely available. Throughout 2019, the Board’s Corporate Governance & Nominating Committee, which met quarterly, was responsible for overseeing Barrick’s policies, programs, and performance relating to the environment, including climate change. The Audit & Risk Committee assisted the Board in overseeing the Company’s management of enterprise risks as well as the implementation of policies and standards for monitoring and mitigating such risks. Climate change is built into our formal risk management process, outputs of which were reviewed by the Audit & Risk Committee throughout 2019. In addition, the Audit & Risk Committee reviewed the Company’s approach to climate change in the context of Barrick’s public disclosure.<br/><br/>We expect our climate change activities to continue into 2020 and beyond. Site-level climate-related risks and mitigation plans will continue to be reviewed in the context of the company-wide risk assessment, and site-level plans to reduce energy and GHG emissions will be strengthened. We also expect to continue providing our climate-related disclosure. Overall, based on the work completed, Barrick continues to build resilience to withstand the potential impacts of climate change and leverage potential opportunities as the global economy transitions to a low-carbon future. |         |
| `Page 65` | **Social license to operate**                           | At Barrick, we are committed to building, operating, and closing our mines in a safe and responsible manner. To do this, we seek to build trust-based partnerships with host governments and local communities to drive shared long-term value while working to minimize the social and environmental impacts of our activities. Geopolitical risks such as resource nationalism and incidents of corruption are inherent in the business of a company operating globally. Past environmental incidents in the extractive industry highlight the hazards (e.g., water management, tailings storage facilities, etc.) and the potential consequences to the environment, community health and safety. Our ability to maintain compliance with regulatory and community obligations in order to protect the environment and our host communities alike remains one of our top priorities. Barrick also recognizes climate change as an area of risk requiring specific focus. |         |

| `Page 2`  | **Introduction**                              | Mining is a business, and like any commercial enterprise it has to change with the times if it is to survive, let alone prosper. In recent years, the world has changed fundamentally, with paradigms shifting almost beyond recognition. Artificial intelligence is transforming the way we communicate, make decisions and execute them. Growing concerns about climate change as well as race and gender inequality are driving thousands of protesters into the streets. Governments have responded to their demands through legislation; major funds have made the newly minted metric, ESG, a prime investment criterion. |         |
| `Page 26` | **Pursuing a higher grade of sustainability** | We discuss issues ranging from community grievances to climate change at the Board, management and operational level and we integrate ESG data into our decisions. This is a critical component in managing our business. In 2020, we produced our ‘ESG handbook’; an internal resource explaining why and how environmental and social considerations are so integral to our business philosophy and to further emphasise the importance Barrick places on sustainability. The handbook provides easy reference to the sustainability vision and policies which have been established post-Merger. |         |
| `Page 54` | **Climate**                                   | In early 2020, we reviewed and updated our climate change strategy. Barrick’s climate change strategy has three pillars: (1) Identify, understand and mitigate the risks associated with climate change; (2) Measure and reduce our impacts on climate change; and (3) Improve our disclosure<br/><br/>**Identify, understand and mitigate the risks associated with climate change** <br/><br/>We continue to take steps to identify and manage risks and build resilience to climate change, as well as to position ourselves for new opportunities.

In 2020, Barrick received a C minus grade on the CDP Climate Change Questionnaire. This grade places Barrick in the ‘awareness’ scoring band. <br/><br/>The Board’s Corporate Governance & Nominating Committee meets quarterly and is responsible for overseeing Barrick’s policies, programs and performance relating to the environment, including climate change. The Audit & Risk Committee assists the Board in overseeing the Group’s management of enterprise risks as well as the implementation of policies and standards for monitoring and mitigating such risks. Climate change is built into our formal risk management process, outputs of which were reviewed by the Audit & Risk Committee throughout 2019 and 2020.<br/><br/>During 2020, we also concluded an update of our global scenario analysis, and we are now advancing an individual site-by-site analysis to better understand the risk that climate change poses to each operation, with an initial focus on our Tier One Gold Assets1. In addition, the Audit & Risk Committee reviewed the Group’s approach to climate change in the context of our public disclosures.<br/><br/>We expect our focus on climate change to continue through 2021 and beyond, with several projects that will further reduce GHG emissions. Those listed below are more advanced in the project lifecycle with capital already committed.<br/><br/>We continue to align our disclosures with the Taskforce on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (“TCFD”) and will work to incorporate scenario analysis into our future disclosures. We have a strong foundation and Barrick continues to build further resilience to withstand the potential impacts of climate change and leverage potential opportunities as the global economy transitions to a low-carbon future. |         |

| `Page 45` | **Responsible environmental stewardship**            | **Building resilience**<br/><br/> In the previous section, we discussed how many of our social development efforts are geared to building the resilience of communities to environmental degradation – from agricultural projects that ensure food security to boreholes that bring access to water. At the same time, we recognize that climate change, including shifts in temperature and more extreme weather, is likely to increasingly affect our operations in the years to come, and we are also building the resilience of our company to climate and wider environmental risks. Since 2019, we have worked to disclose against the requirements of the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) as part of our annual sustainability reporting.<br/><br/>**Climate resilience**<br/><br/> Tackling climate change requires global collective action. Our GHG emissions roadmap sets a target to reduce Scope 1 and 2 emissions by at least 30% by 2030 (from a 2018 baseline), while maintaining a steady production profile. This is a target grounded in practical measures and does not rely on closing mines, lowering production nor aspirational technology.![](C:\Users\Asus\Desktop\666.png) |         |

By measuring and effectively managing our energy use, we can reduce our GHG emissions, achieve more efficient production, and reduce our costs. <br/><br/>We have climate champions at each site that are tasked with identifying roadmaps and assessing feasibility for our GHG emissions reductions and carbon offsets for hard-to-abate emissions. Any carbon offsets that we pursue must have appropriate socioeconomic and/or biodiversity benefits. We have published an achievable emissions reduction roadmap and continue to assess further reduction opportunities across our operations.<br/><br/>**Improve our disclosure on climate change**<br/><br/>As part of our commitment to improve our disclosure on climate change, we complete the annual CDP (formerly known as the Carbon Disclosure Project) Climate Change and Water Security questionnaires. This ensures our investor-relevant water use, emissions and climate data is widely available. <br/><br/>Our CDP scores were positive and although we maintained our B score for Water Security, we improved our Climate Change score a full grade from a C in 2020 to B in 2021. We are also pleased to score as industry leaders for several indicators. For Climate Change, we scored as industry leaders for Governance, Emission Reduction Initiatives, as well as Scope 1 & 2 Emissions. Similarly we achieved industry leader scores in Water-Related Opportunities, Integrated Approach to Environmental Challenges and Business Impacts for Water Security. |         |

| `Page 19` | **MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS** | ![](C:\Users\Asus\Desktop\777.png)<br/><br/>The price of gold is the largest single factor in determining profitability and cash flow from operations, therefore, the financial performance of the Company has been, and is expected to be closely linked to the price of gold. Historically, the price of gold has been subject to volatile price movements over short periods of time and is affected by numerous macroeconomic and industry factors that are beyond the Company’s control. Major influences on the gold price include currency exchange rate fluctuations and the relative strength of the U.S. dollar, the supply of and demand for gold and macroeconomic factors such as the level of interest rates and inflation expectations. During 2017, the price of gold fluctuated between a low of $1,150 per ounce in January to a high of $1,358 per ounce in September. The average price for the year based on the London Bullion Market Association PM Fix was $1,257 per ounce, a $6 per ounce increase over the 2016 average price of $1,251 per ounce. Major influences on the gold price in 2017 included the weakening of the U.S. dollar, negative interest rate policies in Japan and Europe and strong equity markets. Gold weakened with the U.S. Federal Reserve raising interest rates by 75 basis points but rebounded after the interest rate announcements. Investors buying gold exchange-­‐traded funds (“ETF”) increased during 2017. In 2017, gold ETF holdings increased throughout the year, ending the year near the 2016 peak holdings. Gold was also impacted by the continued uncertainty over Brexit and the political climate in the U.S. |         |

The agreement, which came after an extensive due diligence process by the lenders, underpins to their partnership in Tasiast and their confidence in Mauritania’s foreign investment climate. |         |
| `Page 56` | **Climate Risks**                        | A number of governments or governmental bodies have introduced or are contemplating regulatory changes in response to the potential impacts of climate change. Where legislation already exists, regulation relating to emission levels and energy efficiency is becoming more stringent. The changes in legislation and regulation will likely increase the Company’s compliance costs. <br/><br/>In addition, the physical risks of climate change may also have an adverse effect at some of Kinross’ operations. These may include extreme weather events, changes in rainfall patterns, water shortages, and changing temperatures. These physical impacts could require the Company to curtail or close mining production and could prevent the Company from pursuing expansion opportunities. These effects may adversely impact the cost, production and financial performance of the Company’s operations. |         |

| `Page 3`  | **Delivering on our ESG commitments** | In 2020, we improved disclosure on climate, including benchmarking against the recommendations made by the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), and conducted a climate risk and opportunity assessment across all sites. The Company’s performance in environmental stewardship was recognized with a top ranking by the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) Russia’s environmental transparency rating of mining companies. The Alaska Department of Natural Resources also publicly endorsed our successful reclamation of the True North mine, the first large metal mine to be returned to the State and opened for public access. |         |

| `Page 47` | **Climate Risks**                     | A number of governments or governmental bodies have introduced or are contemplating regulatory changes in response to the potential impacts of climate change. Where legislation already exists, regulation relating to emission levels and energy efficiency is becoming more stringent. The changes in legislation and regulation will likely increase the Company’s compliance costs. <br/><br/>In addition, the physical risks of climate change may also have an adverse effect at some of Kinross’ operations. These may include extreme weather events, changes in rainfall patterns, water shortages, and changing temperatures. These physical impacts could require the Company to curtail or close mining production and could prevent the Company from pursuing expansion opportunities. These effects may adversely impact the cost, production and financial performance of the Company’s operations. <br/><br/>Operations at Paracatu are dependent on rainfall and river water capture as the primary source of process water. During the rainy season, the mine channels surface runoff water to temporary storage ponds from where it is pumped to the process plants. Similarly, surface runoff and rain water and water captured from the river is stored in the tailings impoundment, which constitutes the main water reservoir for the process plants. The objective is to capture and store as much water as possible during the rainy season to ensure adequate water supply during the dry season. <br/><br/>Accordingly, prolonged periods without adequate rainfall may adversely impact the Company’s operations. As a result, production may fall below historic or forecast levels and Kinross may incur significant costs or experience significant delays that could have a material effect on Kinross’ financial performance, liquidity and results of operations. <br/><br/>Excessive rainfall or flooding may also adversely affect operations. Excess rainfall can result in operational difficulties including geotechnical instability, increased dewatering demands, and additional water management requirements. Extended periods of above average rainfall at a site may result in increased costs or production disruptions that could have a material effect on Kinross’ financial performance, liquidity and results of operations. <br/><br/>We can provide no assurance that efforts to mitigate the risks of climate changes will be effective and that the physical risks of climate change will not have an adverse effect on the Company’s operations and profitability. |         |

In February 2022, we outlined our Climate Change Strategy, with the objective of a 30% intensity reduction in Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions by 2030. |         |
| `Page 7`  | **SET CLIMATE TARGETS**                | In alignment with our values and our culture, Kinross made significant progress in advancing environmental, social and governance priorities in 2021. We met our ESG commitments, worked to further strengthen our sustainability strategy and governance, and delivered strong performance.![](C:\Users\Asus\Desktop\999.png) |         |
| `Page 8`  | **Strong ESG Performance**             | Kinross continued to achieve strong ESG performance over the year, and consistently ranks well among peers in major ESG rankings and ratings. Kinross was recognized as one of the industry’s top 10 for ESG performance in the S&P Global 2022 Sustainability Yearbook and retained its “A” level rating by MSCI. The Company is on track to complete external assurance to conform with the World Gold Council’s Responsible Gold Mining Principles.![](C:\Users\Asus\Desktop\000.png) |         |
| `Page 59` | **Climate Risks**                      | A number of governments or governmental bodies have introduced or are contemplating regulatory changes in response to the potential impacts of climate change. Where legislation already exists, regulation relating to emission levels and energy efficiency is becoming more stringent. The changes in legislation and regulation will likely increase the Company’s compliance costs. <br/><br/>In addition, the physical risks of climate change may also have an adverse effect at some of Kinross’ operations. These may include extreme weather events, changes in rainfall patterns, water shortages, and changing temperatures. These physical impacts could require the Company to curtail or close mining production and could prevent the Company from pursuing expansion opportunities. These effects may adversely impact the cost, production and financial performance of the Company’s operations. <br/><br/>Operations at Paracatu are dependent on rainfall and river water capture as the primary source of process water. During the rainy season, the mine channels surface runoff water to temporary storage ponds from where it is pumped to the process plants. Similarly, surface runoff and rain water and water captured from the river is stored in the tailings impoundment, which constitutes the main water reservoir for the process plants. The objective is to capture and store as much water as possible during the rainy season to ensure adequate water supply during the dry season. <br/><br/>Accordingly, prolonged periods without adequate rainfall may adversely impact the Company’s operations. As a result, production may fall below historic or forecast levels and Kinross may incur significant costs or experience significant delays that could have a material effect on Kinross’ financial performance, liquidity and results of operations. <br/><br/>Excessive rainfall or flooding may also adversely affect operations. Excess rainfall can result in operational difficulties including geotechnical instability, increased dewatering demands, and additional water management requirements. Extended periods of above average rainfall at a site may result in increased costs or production disruptions that could have a material effect on Kinross’ financial performance, liquidity and results of operations. <br/><br/>We can provide no assurance that efforts to mitigate the risks of climate changes will be effective and that the physical risks of climate change will not have an adverse effect on the Company’s operations and profitability. |         |

| `Page 7` | **High ESG Standards Integral to Running a Profitable Business** | We have always taken our environmental, social and governance (ESG) responsibilities and obligations with the utmost seriousness. We believe that high ESG standards go hand in hand with running a profitable business and attracting investment. Indeed, many of the world’s largest institutional investors are paying much closer attention to ESG performance than ever before. We welcome this attention, and believe our high standards and strong performance in the areas of health, safety, environment, and community relations are competitive advantages for Yamana.<br/><br/>I am pleased to report that our total recordable injury frequency rate fell to 0.57 in 2019, a 5% decrease from 2018, and a 24% decline over the past three years. El Peñón has been a standout in this regard, achieving its second straight year without a lost-time injury. We also continued to advance our climate change strategy last year, implementing action plans to mitigate potential impacts identified by risk assessments conducted in 2018. |         |

| `Page 8`  | **Adoption of board-approved climate strategy**              | From our earliest days, we have placed a relentless focus on ensuring our business responds to critical sustainability imperatives. Holding ourselves to high ESG and sustainability standards underpins our social license to operate, creates positive social outcomes for the communities we serve, and is fully aligned with running a profitable business and attracting investment. <br/><br/>For some, the idea of a social license to operate is a notional one. At Yamana, it is quantified and integrated into our strategy and operations through key metrics like our Social License to Operate Index, which is based on quarterly surveys that measure local perceptions of our ESG performance. We are proud to have developed this approach to measuring how responsibly we are operating, and we will continue to tailor this tool to ensure it remains market leading. <br/><br/>We are taking a similar quantitative approach to climate change. Earlier this year, we formally adopted a board-approved climate strategy, underscoring our commitment to the transition to a low-carbon future. Our climate strategy includes the adoption of two targets: a 2° Celsius science-based target (SBT) and an aspirational net-zero 2050 target. The targets will be supported by foundational work being performed this year to establish a multi-disciplinary climate working group, determine our emissions baseline, develop the greenhouse gas (GHG) abatement pathways required to achieve the 2° Celsius SBT and establish preliminary, operations-specific roadmaps that describe abatement projects, and estimated costs and schedules. These actions will help ensure that our long-range GHG reduction efforts are supported by practical and operationally focused short-, medium-, and long-term actions to achieve our targets.<br/><br/>Our climate strategy, I would add, is a continuation of our climate change actions begun in 2018. Those actions have focused on climate adaptation to ensure our operations are resilient and can adjust to the changes that may occur with a changing climate in terms of energy efficiency, water availability, and biodiversity. This work will continue. |         |
| `Page 9`  | **Performance Highlights**                                   | • Formally adopted a board approved climate strategy underpinned by the adoption of two targets: • 2° C science based target • Aspirational net zero 2050 target <br/><br/>• 16% improvement in our social license since 2018 as measured by third party SLO Index <br/><br/>• Best in class tailings management governance and systems that include regular 3 rd party reviews & monthly oversight by senior management<br/><br/> • Zero process water discharge<br/><br/> • 18% reduction in the total recordable injury rate (TRIR) since 2018 <br/><br/>• 5th consecutive year with no material environmental spills or incidents |         |
| `Page 11` | **Tenacity and talent**                                      | **14% decrease in total recordable injury rate from 2019**<br/><br/>Last year, our total recordable injury rate improved to 0.49, a 14 percent decrease from 2019. We also successfully completed our first year of implementation of objectives associated with the Mining Association of Canada’s Towards Sustainable Mining Framework, a globally recognized sustainability program that supports mining companies in managing key environmental and social risks. <br/><br/>Yamana has always prioritized the health and safety of its workers and communities, environmental protection, and supporting the development of sustainable communities where it operates. The adoption of a board-approved climate strategy that sets clear, science-based targets underscores this commitment to ESG excellence and is a natural extension of our business approach. |         |
| `Page 32` | **HIGHLIGHTS AND RELEVANT UPDATES**                          | As a continuation of Yamana’s climate change actions, the Company has formally adopted a climate strategy, approved by the Board of Directors, to demonstrate the Company’s commitment to the transition to a low-carbon future. The strategy is underpinned by adoption of two targets: a 2°C science-based target (“SBT”) and an aspirational net-zero 2050 target. The targets are supported by foundational work to be performed in 2021 to establish a multi-disciplinary Climate Working Group, determine our emissions baseline, develop the Greenhouse Gas (“GHG”) abatement pathways required to achieve the 2°C SBT and establish preliminary, operations-specific roadmaps that describe abatement projects, estimated costs and schedules. These actions will help ensure that our long-range GHG reduction efforts are supported by practical and operationally focused short, medium and long-term actions to achieve the targets. |         |

If there are no serious hurdles, the project could obtain the necessary approvals from provincial regulators in approximately 12 months. The project team has received a letter confirming that mining the additional zones at the project does not trigger any additional Federal permitting requirements. |         |
| `Page 89` | **HMETAL PRICE RISK**                                        | The Company's profitability and long-term viability depend, in large part, upon the market price of metals that may be produced from the Company's properties, primarily gold and silver. Market price fluctuations of these precious metals could adversely affect profitability of operations and lead to impairments of mineral properties. Metal prices fluctuate widely and are affected by numerous factors beyond the Company's control including but not limited to supply and demand, consumption patterns, macroeconomic factors (interest, exchange, inflation), banking and political conditions, nature and climate condition risks, and mining specific factors. |         |
